# Level 1 — Basic Loop Exercises

This folder contains beginner-friendly exercises focused on understanding the fundamentals of loops in C#.  
The goal is to help you master `for`, `while`, and `do…while` loops without using arrays or complex concepts.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. **Count to N**
Print all integers from `1` to `N` in a single line without spaces.

### 2. **Sum 1..N**
Calculate and print the sum of all integers from `1` to `N`.

### 3. **Factorial Loop**
Compute the factorial of `N` using a loop (without recursion).

### 4. **Pow by Multiplication**
Calculate `A` raised to the power of `B` using repeated multiplication.

### 5. **Digits Count**
Determine and print how many digits are in a non-negative integer `X`.

### 6. **Sum of Digits**
Find and print the sum of all digits of `X`.

### 7. **Product of Digits**
Find and print the product of all digits of `X`.  
If `X` contains a zero, the product will be `0`.
