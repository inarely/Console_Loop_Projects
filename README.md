# Console_Loop_Projects

This repository contains structured C# exercises focused on **loops**, **conditions**, and **basic logic**.  
All tasks are grouped by levels to gradually increase difficulty and improve understanding of loop mechanics.

---

## Levels Overview

### Level 1 — Basic Loops
Covers the very basics of `for`, `while`, and `do…while` loops.  
Focuses on simple counters, accumulators, and number manipulations (sum, product, factorial, powers).

### Level 2 — Conditions & Input Loops
Adds conditional logic (`if/else`), `break`, and input validation.  
Trains processing multiple numbers, finding min/max, checking primality, and stopping on special conditions.

### Level 3 — Nested Loops & Patterns
Introduces **nested loops** and 2D-style thinking.  
Covers pattern printing (triangles, rectangles, chessboards) and digit-based tasks like palindromes and Armstrong numbers.

## Learning Goals

- Build a **solid understanding of loops** and iteration flow.
- Learn to combine loops with **conditions** for more complex logic.
- Practice **digit extraction** with `%` and `/`.
- Learn **nested loop logic** for row/column operations and console patterns.
- Improve code readability by adding comments and consistent formatting.
