# Level 2 — Conditions & Input Loops

This folder contains exercises focused on using **conditions inside loops**,  
working with **break** statements, validating input, and processing numbers step by step.  
These tasks are designed to strengthen your logical thinking when using `for`, `while`, and `do…while`.

## Tasks Overview

### 8. **Reverse Number**
Reverse the digits of a non-negative integer `X` and print the result.  
Leading zeros are omitted (except if `X` is `0`).

---

### 9. **Count Multiples**
Count how many numbers from `1` to `N` are divisible by `3` but **not divisible** by `5`.  
Print the count.

---

### 10. **First Divisor**
Find and print the smallest divisor of `N` (other than `1`).  
Use `break` to stop the loop as soon as the divisor is found.

---

### 11. **Is Prime**
Check if `N` is a prime number.  
Print `YES` if it is prime, `NO` if it is composite.  
Check divisors starting from `2` until you either find one or finish the loop.

---

### 12. **Sentinel Sum**
Keep reading integers and summing them until `0` is entered.  
The `0` itself is not added to the sum.  
After the loop ends, print the total sum.

---

### 13. **Min/Max Stream**
First read `N` — the number of integers to process.  
Then read `N` integers and determine both the minimum and maximum value.  
Print them in the format:
